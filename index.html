                            Using code to solve problems, for people, businesses, and the world. <br>
                            I believe that coding enables us to imagine and create new worlds that are more just,
                            accessible, and efficient. If you want my code in action, links to several of my projects
                            are below.

                        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                        <p>This project used a lot of different technologies: MSSQL for the database; ASP.NET and MVC for structuring the web application; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the presentation; and APIs for Google Maps and the fueleconomy.gov domain. The JavaScript was really neat, as it lets a user have Google Maps populate information about their commute in the appropriate view fields automatically. Pictures of the commute creation view and the JavaScript are below.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <h3>Problems and Solutions</h3>
                        <p>Agile/Scrum was by far the most powerful part of working on this project. Making functional code each sprint meant that my team and I had to take on ownership for our work. We did this through tools like Trello, conventions like regular high-level meetings, and through consensus decision-making. The best part of Agile was using it to solve coding problems: together we were smarter and more effective than we were individually. </p>
                    </li>

                        <h3><a href="https://github.com/kevingilfether/AQACommute">GitHub</a></h3>
                        <p>Version control was essential on a project of this scope. The AQA Commute team decided quickly on a feature branching Git workflow, with "submasters" made for each sprint. This gave us a lot of flexibility and power: it was always easy to present a functional product, but also to take productive risks. One thing I wasnt't expecting, but was really happy about: I became the "Git Ninja" in my Agile team on this project. I "drove" on dozens of merge conflicts, helped keep track of which team members touched what code, and gave occasional Git lessons.</p>

                        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                        <p>I really wanted to make sure the website was responsive, as bands or DIY music fans are usually closer to a phone than a computer screen. I used C#/.NET, Razor, ASP.NET MVC, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap for this project.</p>

                        <h3>Problems and Solutions</h3>
                        <p>This project grew from my love of DIY rock and roll. My goal for this project was to make a resource similar to <a href="http://dodiy.org/">DoDIY</a>, or the now defunct <a href="http://www.byofl.org/">Book Your Own Life</a>, but with more of a review spin. I had a lot of fun with getting the glyphicons of stars to populate correctly. Razor logic and picture of result below. </p>

                        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                        <p>This project is a C# console application created using the object-oriented programming principles of inheritance and polymorphism. I paid special attention layout on the console view and setting up classes in a logical and realistic way. </p>

                        <h3>Problems and Solutions</h3>
                        <p>I had a lot of fun playing with parameters for the different methods! Passing in an object and using its properties to manipulate it or perform operations was instructive. I can see how more complex programs in industry would rely upon careful design of parameters and properties, especially where protecting user information is concerned. </p>

                        <h3><a href="https://github.com/kevingilfether/Bank_account">GitHub</a></h3>
                        <p>Here, I designed my classes first and laid out my Main method according to the DRY principle. This led to simplified and straightforward logic, making for code that is easy to understand.</p>

                        <p>I used HTML, CSS, the Bootstrap library, and a little bit of JavaScript. I like to think of the website like a building: HTML is the structure, CSS is the styling, Bootstrap is there to make it accessible to everyone, and JavaScript is the motion and brightness.</p>

                        <p>The fun part of working this page was working from a design that was given to me. Working from specifications that someone else had created was fun, and stretched my skill: I had to learn to approach the design task as a web developer fulfilling a customer's needs.</p>

                        <p>Styling, styling, <strong>styling</strong>. Here, version control made it easy for me to think like a drafter. I could try an entirely different style, change my entire style sheet, and not lose my work if I wanted to crumple it up and throw it away. More than once, I changed something, and then changed it back. The creative process, am I right?</p>

                            I'm a junior software developer with an extensive background in business administration and education. I studied for my BA at Oberlin College, my Master's in STEM education at Tufts University, and full stack web app development at We Can Code IT. When I'm not coding, I most enjoy playing music. My most recent project, <a href="https://spacefuneral.bandcamp.com/album/city-of-forms">Space Funeral</a> has toured the eastern part of the US, playing with DIY and internationally famous acts alike.
